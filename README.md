PROJECT HAS BEEN MOVED TO GITLAB - https://gitlab.com/enzanki_ars/rocket-league-replay-analysis

This project has been moved to GitLab to make development and testing easier.  GitHub does not 
have integrated testing features, while GitLab has testing features built in that makes running 
customized tests easier to run. 

## Project Status

This project was not maintained for a long stretch of time.  Recently, maintenance has resumed. 
In this time though, the project does not work anymore for recent replays for newer versions. 
Work has resumed on restoring the project to a working state, but it will result in some major 
changes to how the program will be installed/run.  I will update this page and post on Reddit 
when the program is back to a working state.  

# Rocket League Replay Analysis

**Version:** v1.4.0-alpha3

## Licences

## Installation

* A replay from Rocket League
  * Windows: `Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Demos`
  * macOS: `Library/Application Support/Rocket League/TAGame/Demos`
  * Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/Rocket League/TAGame/Demos`
* Ensure [FFMPEG](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is installed and on the `PATH`
  * Windows: Make sure to add it to the path.
    1. Copy the path of the folder you installed FFmpeg to in explorer while in the "bin" pat
    2. Open the start menu (or Cortana…) and search for "Environment Variables"
    3. Select "Edit the system environment variables"
    4. Select "Environment Variables…" at the bottom of the window.
    5. In the "User Variables" section, click on "Path" and select "Edit"
    6. Click "New" and paste the FFmpeg path. Make sure it ends with bin, otherwise reread line 1.
* Download [RocketLeagueReplayParser](https://github.com/jjbott/RocketLeagueReplayParser/releases)
  * Linux/Mac Only: I am not certain this tool works on this platform. The
  README claims that it does not, but I doubt this... I will update this
  with more information soon.  If it does work, you will need to install
  [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).
* Download a precompiled version or download the sourcecode.
  * Currently, I only compile builds for Windows. Linux/Mac users can use
  the `Source code (zip)` option.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run RocketLeagueReplayParser on your replay file.
    * Note for Mac/Linux users: Add `mono` to the beginning of all of the 
    commands for RocketLeagueReplayParser.
    * Run `RocketLeagueReplayParser.exe example.replay --fileoutput`
2. Run `python -m rocketleaguereplayanalysis.main [args]` replacing 
`[args]` with the program arguments you wish to use.  Leave empty to see help.
    * If you are running a precompiled version, run that 
    executable name instead, for example `rocketleaguereplayanalysis.exe`

                                  game_json

positional arguments:
  game_json             The name of the game json.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --render {player-data-boost,

              scoreboard,
              total-boost} ...]
                        Select which renders are created. 
                        Multiple renders can be separated by a space.
  --render_all          Render all possible videos.
  --data_explorer       Explore the given data.
  --export_parsed_data_json
                        Export the parsed data as JSON.
  --export_parsed_data_csv
                        Export the parsed data as CSV.
  --show_field_size     Show the calculated field size.
  --sync_to_live_recording
                        Instead of syncing to a recording of the in-game
                        replay, sync to a recording of the game played live.
                        In other words, if you have recorded the game as you
                        were playing it, set this argument to sync to that
                        recording. If you recorded the replay after the game
                        ended, do not add this argument to sync to that
                        recording.
  --version             Print version and exit (v1.4.0-alpha3)
```

## Known Issues

* This program assumes that the ball has traveled the farthest from center 
in both the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` directions, though the `Z` distance is not 
important yet.  If the ball does not ever hit the side boundary of the map, 
then the size of the field is not accurately displayed.  In a later version, 
both the players and the ball will be used in the calculation of the field 
boundaries.
